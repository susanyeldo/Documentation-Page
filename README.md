# Cover Letter


Respected Authorities,

I would love to be a part of the “Hyperledger Caliper documentation platform update”
project. I first came across this project having read the experience of one of the previous
mentees, whose opinion of the company greatly intrigued me to explore what Hyperledger
does. I was also clocked in on the meetup session where the leaders and past mentees shared
their experiences on April 10, 2024.

A little background about me - my name is Susanna Yeldo. I am a third year undergraduate,
majoring in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.
Having fallen in love with the concepts of Machine Learning has driven me to learn core
computer science subjects and seek opportunities in the software space.
I have previously contributed to an open source project - Hong Kong Rainstorm Record
Analysis where I utilised Machine Learning to draw trends and make predictions on future
rainfall patterns. I can work with numerous languages like Python, R, C++ and Javascript.
Moreover, I keep in touch with the latest technological advancements so am used to
deciphering poorly written documentation. I am an extremely enthusiastic learner with
experience in writing whitepapers, mostly in the financial domain. I am familiar with
theoretical CI/CD aspects and am excited to be able to contribute to real time projects.
I would love to gain practical experience in project and release management of open source
projects, general tasks around open source governance and learn a few tools for open source
project production with practical experience.

While I have contributed to multiple technical projects in terms of code, I would love to learn
to maintain documentation of large code bases and project management skills. Having a
mentor to guide me as I take my baby steps would prove to be invaluable to my future career
as a Machine Learning Engineer, where documentation makes or breaks the code. Speed
reading code to obtain summaries is also one of the skills I am actively trying to develop.
I truly hope you consider me for this mentorship. My eagerness and capacity to learn and
contribute will not let you down.


Thanking you,

Susanna Yeldo
